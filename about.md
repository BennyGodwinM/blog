My interest in Space was sparked on December 18, 2014, by the first test flight of the GSLV MK3 launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation. It sparked my dream of being involved in Aerospace. Later, I learned how much the industry contributes to the technology that surrounds usâ€“like the ballpoint pen, Super Glue, and scratch-resistant glass.

I really want to share what I learn through my journey and try and interest or help those who may need it.
